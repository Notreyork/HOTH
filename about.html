	When you look at Lola, you see mostly water—one day, they will hasten to join a cloud. She is against capital, prisons, borders, and ecocide. They think of them-self as an food-sovereignty activist, envisioning a world where there is enough food and cider for everyone.  Animated by collective desires, they know one thing for certain: to cook companionship into food is to taste and become fellowship. In the unmaking and remaking of this world, they braid recipes, collage on plates, translate ancestry into gardens, and collaborate in kitchen compositions. Pleasure, rage, embodiment in excess—she wants to teach others that we must eat a leaf with a hole, for to believe in nourishment with a caterpillar is to believe in sharing.
