	<h1>Farm - 2024</h1>

	<p>
		This season unlocked new depths of healing, a quiet dialogue between hands and soil. The earth, softer and more yielding, cradled each step, while the seedlings, now more resolute, pushed their roots deeper into its embrace. Immense gratitude to Sundance Harvest for providing us with the robust, healthy seedlings that guided us through the season.

		Soon, Lola’s hands would wrap around a trellis, hoisting it upright. T-posts were driven into the earth, promising steadfast support for the tomatoes. My heartfelt thanks to the folx who helped unroll the cattle fence. As the work unfolded, creatures quietly entered their periphery: a caterpillar here, a chipmunk there, a grouse lingering, tracing our steps. The bees, tireless in their diligence, expanded their colony, preparing their stores of honey for the winter months ahead. 
		<br>
		<br>
		It was this season, as the rhythms of growth intertwined with the hum of daily life, that a name emerged: Honey on the Heart. It rose from the honey that had to fill the cracks in Red Rocket’s heart. So much love.
