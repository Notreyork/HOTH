	<h1>Farm</h1>

	<p>
		Lola’s grandparents purchased 25 acres in Adjala-Tosorontio in the 1970s, land long stewarded by the Wendat (Huron), Haudenosaunee, and Anishinaabe peoples, including the Mississaugas and Ojibwe. Shaped by millennia of wisdom and tradition, this land holds the complexities of agricultural practices disrupted by colonization, like the cultivation of the Three Sisters. As a descendant of European settlers, Lola often reflects on what it means to cultivate here, to host, and to rest upon land with such a storied past. How can she tend to it in a way that honors its original stewards and their enduring wisdom? 
		<br>
		<br>
		Acknowledging past wrongs is merely the beginning. Lola seeks to deepen her understanding of the land’s true history, striving to build collaborative, meaningful relationships with Indigenous communities. She understands that this journey requires listening, learning, and mutual respect, a slow, patient process demanding vulnerability and real accountability. Growing food is not just about crops; it is about cultivating respect for the land and its stewards. This work is ongoing, and Lola is committed to learning, listening, and honoring the land through collaboration. Through these efforts, she hopes to contribute, however subtly, to the healing of the land.
